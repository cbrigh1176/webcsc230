    <h3>About me</h3>

    <div class="why">
      <p>
        Why I decided to take a journey into the world of Information
        technology? Well imy explanation is simple. I have spend many years of
        my life using my body doing duties such as city sanitation work, machine
        operations, Massage therapy, personal fitness training and more... My
        body won't last forever so I decided to learn something that requires
        major brain power. Information technology is foreign lands for me so I
        decided to offer mmyself the challenge and enroll at the age of 41 years
        old. The journey begins now...
